# webcrawlerhttp
Project for the Boot.dev Learn HTTP course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JYT5f2isg4&t=15683s)

Set as a private GitHub repository because this is a working web-crawler-based project that will be enhanced and added to my portfolio. Lane provided a great idea to instead of printing the SEO report in the console, to export it as an Excel spreadsheet or another format. 

## ü§ù Contributing
Please feel free to contribute to this project. I would love to see more ideas on how this SEO report can be used to enhance many Web search results!
